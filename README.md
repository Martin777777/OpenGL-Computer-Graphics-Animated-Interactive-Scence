The interaction will also be different when the magician do different actions. For example, if the magician holds a magic bar, it waves the magic bar and after the waving, its assistant will disappear/appear and when the magician holds nothing, he waves his arm and the audience will clap.
8. T: Let the assistant do his action. In the story of this project, only when the assistant goes out of a magic box, he does the action.
